Structure:
Y-Axis (Left Side): The labels on the left side represent different Role IDs or components in your system. These could be services, applications, or specific modules like coupos_order_agg, fds_hadoop, mobile_service_gw, etc.

X-Axis (Bottom): The timeline runs along the bottom of the graph, marked with timestamps in HH:MM:SS format (hours, minutes, seconds).

Graph Content:
Timeline Rows: Each row corresponds to a specific Role ID or component, showing events or alerts for that particular role over time.

Markers/Points: The points or markers on each timeline row represent events, alerts, or statuses for that particular Role ID at specific times. For example:

Red squares: Could indicate a particular type of event or alert, possibly an error or critical alert.
Orange triangles: Might represent another type of event, such as warnings or ongoing processes.
Pop-up Details:
Event Details (Tooltip): Hovering over a marker shows a tooltip with more details. For example, the pop-up in the image shows:
Event: BENEFIT IN PROGRESS
Triggered by: zero007
Ticket: EERP-17064
Timestamp: 2024-08-23 07:48:05
Refresh Information:
Refresh Interval: The graph is set to refresh every 10 seconds.
Time Range: The graph is showing data from 2024-08-23 07:40:05 to 2024-08-23 08:10:05.
Summary:
The graph provides a visual overview of events occurring across multiple system roles or components over a defined time range. Each row corresponds to a specific role, and the timeline shows when specific events or alerts occurred for each role. The tooltip provides additional context for each event when you hover over a marker.

This visualization is useful for monitoring and troubleshooting by allowing quick identification of when and where events happen in your system.
